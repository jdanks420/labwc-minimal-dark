# minimal dark mode for labwc

as a keyboard focused user i have made a keybind scheme for easy memorization and comfort

#### installation

    this is very easy simply click the green code button 
    and download as a zip. extract it and paste the contents into ~/.config


### CTRL + Arrows
    > this controls the window snapping maintaining gaps

### Super + Arrows/1-9
    > this controls workspace navigations

### Super + Shift + 1-9
    > controls send to workspace {x}

### Alt + Tab
    > the brains of the operation, switch focus between windows
