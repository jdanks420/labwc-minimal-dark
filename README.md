as a keyboard focused user i have made a keybind scheme for easy memorization and comfort

### Ctrl + Arrows
    > this controls the window snapping maintaining gaps

### Super + Arrows/1-9
    > this controls workspace navigations

### Super + Shift + 1-9
    > controls send to workspace {x}

### Alt + Tab
    > the brains of the operation, switch focus between windows

## other keybinds
```
alt + space       rofi
super + space     ghostty
super + n         nemo
alt + r           yazi
alt + s           search startpage
alt + w           rofi wallpaper switcher
alt + q           kill window
alt + n/m         volume down/up
alt + p           screenshot into swappy
alt + z           maximize window with gaps
```
